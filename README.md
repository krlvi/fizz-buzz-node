# FizzBuzz

This is an implementation of the fizz buzz game

## How it works

Counts from 1 to 100.

For any number which is divisible by 3 it prints Fizz.
For any number divisible by 5 it prints Buzz.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, prints FizzBuzz.

Otherwise prints the number itself.

## Runnint it
